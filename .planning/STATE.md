## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: All phases depend on OSC client foundation addressing 4/7 critical pitfalls (UDP packet loss, request correlation, timeouts, Ableton busy state)
- Phase 5: Sample indexer has no OSC dependency, can run parallel with Phases 3-4
- Phase 8: DEV-05 and DEV-06 are stretch items (human-readable device names, preset browsing) due to research flagging AbletonOSC browser API uncertainty

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

**Pre-Phase 1:**
- AbletonOSC installation on Ubuntu Linux not yet verified (research validated macOS paths only)
- AbletonOSC Live 12 Suite compatibility assumed but not tested
- `osc` npm package current version and stability not verified

**Phase 5 (Sample Indexer):**
- User's sample library formats and naming conventions unknown, may require heuristic adjustments

**Phase 6 (Device Control):**
- AbletonOSC device browser and preset loading API capabilities uncertain, may need workarounds or v2 deferral for DEV-05/DEV-06
